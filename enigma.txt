All parts of the coursework have been attempted, including 1 extension.


How to operate the Enigma Machine:

	Each test of the coursework is coded into the machine. To run each test, the user has to
	uncomment the specific part of the test that needs to be ran and comment back all the other
	parts. To help the user, all parts of the tests have been surrounded by comment blocks.
	After each test, the comments should be added back so that they don't interfere with the other tests.
	The input is written in the 'Input.txt' file on 1 line

	Test 1:
		-in the EnigmaMachine class, start() method, uncomment the code for TEST 1 (lines 91-109)
		-in the EnigmaFile class, print() method, uncomment "System.out.println(sentence);" (line 54)
		-in the Main class, uncomment "printer.print(machine);" (line 16)
		
		#The output of the first test is BADGER
	TEST 2:
		-in the EnigmaMachine class, start() method, uncomment the code for TEST 2 (lines 111-130)
		-in the EnigmaFile class, print() method, uncomment "System.out.println(sentence);" (line 54)
		-in the Main class, uncomment "printer.print(machine);" (line 16)

		#The output of the second test is SNAKE
	TEST 3:
		-in the EnigmaMachine class, start() method, uncomment the code for TEST 3 (lines 132-151)
		-in the EnigmaFile class, print() method, uncomment "System.out.println(sentence);" (line 54)
		-in the Main class, uncomment "printer.print(machine);" (line 16)

		#The output of the third test is THEQUICKBROWNFOXJUMPEDOVERTHELAZYDOG
	CHALLENGE 1:
		-in the EnigmaMachine class, start() method, uncomment the code for CHALLENGE 1 (lines 153-167)
		-in the EnigmaFile class, print() method, uncomment the conditional print for the word "ANSWER" (line 56-68)
		-in the Main class, uncomment "bombeMachine.plugTester(machine);" (line 17)

		#There are several outputs containing the word "ANSWER" for this challenge
		#The output which makes the most sense is DAISYDAISYGIVEMEYOURANSWERDO
		#For this output, the machine used the plugs S-A and D-T
	CHALLENGE 2:
		-in the EnigmaMachine class, start() method, uncomment the code for CHALLENGE 2 (lines 169-182)
		-in the EnigmaFile class, print() method, uncomment the conditional print for the word "ELECTRIC" (line 69-79)
		-in the Main class, uncomment "bombeMachine.positionTester(machine);" (line 18)

		#The output for the second challenge is WELLALWAYSBETOGETHERHOWEVERFARITSEEMSWELLALWAYSBETOGETHERTOGETHERINELECTRICDREAMS
		#The first rotor's positions is 6
		#The second rotor's positions is 9
		#The third rotor's positions is 15
	CHALLENGE 3:
		-in the EnigmaMachine class, start() method, uncomment the code for CHALLENGE 3 (lines 184-202)
		-in the EnigmaFile class, print() method, uncomment the conditional print for the word "JAVA" (line 80-90)
		-in the Main class, uncomment "bombeMachine.rotorTester(machine);" (line 19)

		#The output for the third challenge is ILOVECOFFEEILOVETEAILOVETHEJAVAJIVEANDITLOVESME
		#The first rotor is type V
		#The second rotor is type III
		#The third rotor is type II

The EXTENTION for this coursework consists in converting the input file into appropriate text for encoding/decoding.
This includes removing any whitespace, capitalising all letters in the file and removing any characters that can’t be encoded, including punctuation.
The extension code begins in the EnigmaFile class, on line 38.
